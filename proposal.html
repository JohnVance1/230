    <img class="center" src="elements.png" alt="Element Picture">
    
    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p>While defeating enemies and solving puzzles the player uses and collects abilities to become the most powerful wizard. The player will use their abilities to solve puzzles</p>
    
    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <p>The game will be a 2D sidescrolling platformer with puzzle elements related to the abilities.</p>
    
    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>I'm planning on making it a desktop only game.</p>
    
    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The player is collecting all of the abilities that they can in order to become the most powerful wizard they can.</p>
    
    <div>
        <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
        <p>The graphics style will be styles in a 16 bit style with the sound being a somewhat simple ambient track. A lot of the sound will be based on the different abilities and elements that the player has at their disposal.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>The player will be able to choose up to two abilities that they can use at any one time. The player will also be able to switch between the abilites that they have aquired. The player will use these abilities as well as jumping to be able to defeat enemies and solve puzzles.</p>

        <div class="gameplay">

            <h3>Control</h3>
            <p>The controls will be keyboard and mouse woth the player using WASD to move, SPACE to jump, and using Q and E for the different abilities. The mouse would be used to aim the abilities.</p>

            <h3>Onboarding</h3>
            <p>There will be a tutorial level or two before the game starts. Also after each new ability is acquired there will be a level made for that ability to be tried out on.</p>

            <h3>Player Learning</h3>
            <p>Throughout the game the puzzles will get more difficult and the player will learn how to use their abilities in different ways to solve the puzzles. </p>
